# Racket-Projects

Welcome to the **Racket-Projects** repository! This repository contains four projects developed during the Computer Science first-year course, showcasing various applications of Racket programming language.

## Project 1: Traffic-Lights

The first project focuses on Programming and Design using Racket. It involves building a Trafficlights simulation by integrating Racket with Arduino for a realistic experience.

## Project 2: TuringMachine-Emulator

The second project presents a Virtual Turing Machine simulation implemented in Racket. Explore the fundamentals of Turing Machines and their computation capabilities.

## Project 3: FSM-calculator

The third project involves a regex matcher developed in Racket. Delve into Finite State Machines and learn how to match regular expressions.

## Project 4: Mirto-Robot

The fourth project combines Programming and Networking in Racket. Run a Racket network server on Raspberry Pi to control MIRTO (the Middlesex Robotic plaTfOrm), also known as Myrtle.

## Getting Started

Each project has its own directory with the source code and relevant files. Explore the details and instructions provided in their respective README.md files within their directories.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Racket installed on your system to run and test these projects.

## Technologies Used

- Racket - A general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language.
- Arduino - For hardware interaction and simulations.
- Raspberry Pi - For network server implementation.

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have any suggestions for improvements or want to add more Racket projects, feel free to submit a pull request.
