# TuringMachine-Emulator

Welcome to the **TuringMachine-Emulator** project! This is the second project developed during the Computer Science first-year course, presenting a Virtual Turing Machine simulation implemented in Racket.

## Overview

The TuringMachine-Emulator project explores the concept of Turing Machines, fundamental theoretical devices in computer science. We aim to build a virtual Turing Machine simulation using Racket to demonstrate its computation capabilities.

## Getting Started

To run this project and experience the Virtual Turing Machine simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `TuringMachine-Emulator` directory.
3. Run the Racket code to interact with the Virtual Turing Machine simulation.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following:

- Racket - Installed on your system to execute the Racket code.

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have any suggestions for improvements or want to add more features to the Virtual Turing Machine simulation, feel free to submit a pull request.

## License

This project is under the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), allowing you to use, modify, and distribute the code freely.
