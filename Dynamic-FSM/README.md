# FSM-calculator

Welcome to the **FSM-calculator** project! This is the third project developed during the Computer Science first-year course, focusing on a regex matcher implemented in Racket.

## Overview

The FSM-calculator project involves building a Finite State Machine (FSM) based regex matcher using Racket. We aim to explore the concept of Finite State Machines and their applications in matching regular expressions.

## Getting Started

To run this project and use the FSM-calculator regex matcher, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `FSM-calculator` directory.
3. Run the Racket code to utilize the FSM-based regex matching functionality.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following:

- Racket - Installed on your system to execute the Racket code.

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have any suggestions for improvements or want to add more features to the FSM-calculator regex matcher, feel free to submit a pull request.

## License

This project is under the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), allowing you to use, modify, and distribute the code freely.
